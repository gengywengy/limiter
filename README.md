Sick of fights dragging out? Are players getting too OP? Limit the amount of items they can have in their inventory to combat this! 
By default the plugin limits players to only having 16 cobwebs in their inventory at a time, however you can modify the config easily to make it so ANY item is limited. For example, you can limit Golden Apples to 8 so that players can't spam them and prolong fights.

## Future Plans
- Crafting Limiter (Limit how many times an item can be crafted, server-wide or per players)
- Enchant Level Limiter (Limit the max level of specific enchants, or how many enchants can be applied to items)
- Potion Limiter (Limit what potion effects can be applied or what level they can be applied at)
